                    Our summer camp program is the perfect way to spend a summer. Time outdoors, plenty of exercise, and lots of fun. Our program is designed for beginners as well as intermediate players. The program lasts between 2 or 3 days, and runs from 9am to 4pm every day. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first day is spent in different classes. We teach the kids everything they need to know about the equipment, the importance of the protective equipment, and how to perform maintenance on the guns. <strong>Sportsmanship, teamwork</strong>, and <strong>cooperation</strong> are a key part of the classes as we teach the kids to work together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After that, our training focuses on developing the skills needed to be a "pro". We teach the kids how to clear rooms, perform snapshots, and communicate. Kids will leave our summer camp with the skills of an advanced player, and hopefully a lifetime love of the sport. Our typical summer camp is about 20-40 kids, offering a lot of opportunities to make friends. We have kids visiting from Delaware, New York, Maryland and all over the country. Parents can spend the day enjoying the beauty of Pennsylvania, while the kids spend the day at camp.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After orientation day, we break the kids into groups and run them through all our courses. From speedball, attacking and defending the castle, fighting it out in the city, and exploring all of the woods fields. The kids experience every single one of our fields with a variety of scenarios to give them a feel for how they are different. Kids play a lot of games and have an absolutely blast. Our airsoft summer camp is the summer experience for many of these kids. We love seeing the smiling faces come back, slightly taller, year after year.
