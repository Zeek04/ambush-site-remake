Our staff has years of paintball and airsoft experience to help get you started. Our team is always available to assist with any questions or problems you may have, as well as offer some tips to help new players get into the game. If you are interested in trying airsoft or paintball, or have been playing for years, come on down and experience our fields.</p>

                    <h2>Our Fields</h2>
                        <p id="header-text">Our field consits of 35 acres of wood fields, a lego castle,  a 4 acre city field with 20 buildings, three small villages, a 5000 square foot two story castle, as well as a safe zone where players can interact with each other and get their equipment, and more.

                                <p>Our castle is a sight to see, take, and hold. Complete with parapets, elevated walkways, and a courtyard that can make for a deadly kill zone. Two stories tall allowing for both elevated sightlines, as well as the increased vulnerability from an elevated position. Teams will need to make use of communication to effectively attack and hold the castle. Over 5000 square feet, the castle gives plenty of room to maneuver once inside. Just getting past the walls leads attackers into a confined space making for an intense experience. This is our favorite field for an attack and defend scenario, and everyone should experience the thrill of sieging the castle at least once.</p>

                                <p>Close quarters city combat is intense and can be used for a wide variety of games. Our city is built like an actual small town, with the buildings named. Spread over a full four acres, our small town contains 20 buildings including 10 full sized mobile homes. Smaller campers dot the landscape and there are three towers allowing for an elevated position to scout the area. All the windows and doors have been removed to allow ease of entrance and exit. This produces surprising sight lines as threats can come from anywhere. You have the close quarters of going down hallways and rooms, combined with the longer distances in the streets.<br>
                                    On this map you will need to stay on guard. This map looks and feels like a town. The layout has been designed to mimic a real small town. The buildings are named to correspond to real world locations and are designed to mimic their real world counterparts. The church for instance is set inside a churchyard complete with graves. Buildings such as the grocery store or hardware store are great for scenario games. Can you collect tools in the hardware store and then disarm a bomb in the grocery store before the other team stops you?</p>

                                <p>We offer four woods fields spread out over 25-28 acres of Pennsylvania woodlands, rolling hills, and several small villages. During the spring and summer months the terrain is green and thick with underbrush to block sight lines and offering wonderful opportunities for ambushes. During the fall and winter when the leaves drop sitelines can be more open, but the debris can make for perfect hiding spots. Each of the wood fields is a little different, from easier or rougher terrain, rolling hills, and various other fixtures.<br>
                                    Three of the woods fields offer small villages to take and hold, with a variety of buildings allowing for some exciting custom objectives. One of our fields includes our famous Bunker hill. We created the Bunker Hill area to resemble a real World War II defended position. The field is complete with pillboxes to fight in, and around. Nearby is the village of Bunker Town, complete with 16 buildings. Perfect for a small scale cityfight deathmatch, capture the flag, or with a custom objective. Our final village located in the woods resembles a speedball field with your ability to quickly move in and out of buildings.Move quick to secure the area, but don’t get trapped.</p>

Both are constructed from wood and other materials to give a more solid feel. You can hear the paintballs impacting the wood near your head. When you just want to unwind and enjoy a quick game, speedball is a great way to hone your movement skills or work on your teamwork. Rounds go quickly, so mistakes do not mean you are out of the game for long.</p>
